    "articleBody": "THIS year, the extraordinarily wealthy flocked to space. After decades of deferred promises, the space tourism industry got going in earnest, beginning with short flights aboard privately funded craft.Three different commercial ventures carried ultra-rich passengers into space in 2021. It began with Richard Branson, who took a 90-minute suborbital flight aboard his Virgin Galactic space plane, SpaceShipTwo, on 3 jan. Whether or not the flight counts as having gone to space, though, remains a contentious subject-the US government defines space as beginning 50 miles (or just over 80 kilometres) up, which was the altitude of Branson's flight, but the internationally held definition of space, the Karman line, is 100 kilometres above Earth.",
